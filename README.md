## In Your Pocket 

In Your Pocket is an alternative solution and unofficial client for the [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) web service. It provides additional features and in-browser [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) experience. In Your Pocket is inspired by the open-source project [In My Pocket](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/in-my-pocket/) for Mozilla Firefox.
